## Description

VisualPlanner provides an intuitive interface for users to manage their tasks and meetings. The app is built using React, with react-bootstrap for styling and layout, react-router and react-router-dom for navigation between pages, and **World Time API** for capturing task creation times. Additionally, the ToDo component uses two React packages: **react-toastify** and **react-icons**.

- Planner Page with the ToDo component:
  - Add new todos with a timestamp
  - Remove todos
  - Mark todos as completed
  - Display notifications using react-toastify when the user doesn't fill the forms
  - Stylish icons using react-icons
- Meeting Page with the Meetings component:
  - Add new meetings with a timestamp
  - Remove meetings
  - Mark meetings as completed
  - Organize and sort meetings based on time
